                        <p>I am a Salvadoran Daca recipient who is majoring in business. I
                            have been a Senator-at-Large for 4 semesters in both the Rockville and Silver Spring
                            campuses. I have been in the Senate long enough to know what events and issues benefit the
                            student. I always thrive to become a better leader placing myself in a leadership position
                            that
                            will help me grow. The student senate is a group of young leaders who identify and advocate
                            issues affecting the student body to administrators, and host events to make the Montgomery
                            college experience more memorable for students. I aim to improve the Rockville campus life
                            by
                            submitting a request to open up a mental gym that will create a space for students to relax
                            and
                            learns techniques to distress from life because I believe that distressing will help
                            students
                            become more successful in college.</p>

                        <p>Hello! My name is Maeve Kepgang, I am a biological science major. Throughout the year I have
                            been at Montgomery College, I have served on the Rockville student senates as senator at
                            large. Being part of the student senate has been a great experience for me. I’ve learned
                            many professional skills that have prepared me to be great leader. I have had the chance to
                            work with some amazing people, who motivated me to get out of my shell and make a change. I
                            am running for senate president, because I believe I have what it takas to be a great
                            president. I am very hard-working and extremely passionate about my work. My goal is to
                            ensure that students enjoy their time being at Montgomery College, so that even when they
                            graduate, they will have a happy memory of the time they were MC students. </p>

                            the Rockville campus, I
                            have always strived to go above and beyond for the MC Community. As your Vice President I
                            hope to
                            not only fulfill my assigned duties, but find other ways to support the campus such as
                            increasing
                            attendance and school spirit at athletic games, and working to get students more involved in
                            service
                            learning in the community and at MC. Looking forward to next year, Raptors! </p>

                            College’s Executive Board. I recently joined as the Senate in the spring of 2019 and it
                            changed my outlook of how I viewed Montgomery College. I learned about the many exciting
                            plans that were in store for students and reluctantly wanted to participate in every event
                            offered. From planning a talent show to partaking in an outdoor spring festival, these
                            events taught me the sacrifices that have to be made to ensure a successful outcome for my
                            fellow peers. For the upcoming fall I wish to continue the path, along with proposing new
                            activities by working with my fellow senators to ensure everyone’s opinions are heard and
                            met because without their support, the Student Senate would have no purpose. </p>

                            executive board in the student senate. The student senate consist of student
                            representatives. Representatives that advocate for student issues and help/plan out with any
                            activities they can on campus to make the students feel more at ease. The qualities I posses
                            that can help me be an effective board member is that; I have high self-confidence, good
                            communication skills, a sense of structure and a determined spirit. The fact that I have
                            done a few volunteering programs in the past which all turned out well. I have the sense
                            that my leadership skills are worth using as an executive board member. To improve campus
                            life, I would proponent student matters and affairs effectively for instance the problem
                            with the 3rd floor in the Rockville library being too cold for students to read properly.

                        <p>Hey Raptors! My name is Ivy Tsuma and I am running to be your Secretary. I am a current
                            student here at Montgomery College and I’m a Public Health major. Regarding the role of the
                            Student Senate I believe they should be ready to address common student issues and enhance
                            campus life for all students. A few attributes that I believe will make me an excellent
                            member
                            on the Student Senate Executive Board are my communication skills, dedication, and charisma.
                            My personal journey began in high school as I tried finding my place but always seemed to
                            fall
                            short as I was very timid in voicing my opinions. However, through my experience I
                            persevered
                            and acquired the boldness that I needed to connect personally with my peers and fellow MC
                            students. As a student myself I feel connected when more social activities are available on
                            campus. </p>

                        <p>My name is Ishita Ramola and i am a freshman in Montgomery college. My major is business and
                            being a business major i think, running for treasurer is a perfect position for me.

                            A student senate plays a critical role in representing student perspectives in the
                            discussion of all campus issues. Senate also oversees all senate recognized clubs and
                            organization of the college.

                            I see a leadership quality within myself that will help me to be an affective and
                            contributing member of the student senate executive board. I think am capable of handling
                            figures and cash.

                            Being a treasurer i make sure that i will help the clubs by raising money for different
                            events. I would make sure that everything happening in campus in within the budget.

                            Thank you</p>
